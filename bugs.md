## TODO

- pulldown refresh

## PENDING

- joining class is SLOW (cannot figure out why for now)

- automatically load dorm in settings page

- should users change their names?

- sometimes two notes are created when the user wrote only once

- functionality: remove notes

- limit number of requests (not sure yet)

- update storage when data changed

- HANDLE ALL DATA PROCESSING IN THE BACK-END (safety?)

## RESOLVED (PERHAPS)

- ensure the user type their real name

- update crel after every removal of student

- toast flashes

- make newer notes appear in the front

- append the word 'teacher' to every instance (write note)

- teacherkey verification and change

- clear storage during user removal
